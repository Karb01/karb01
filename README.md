# Hello World!! 🌎

Hello! I am **Kaynan**, a graduate in **Data Analysis and Development** from the Universidade de São Caetano do Sul. 🎓

My degree gave me a strong foundation in data, covering everything from analysis to visualization.  
As a **Data Analyst**, I focus on turning data into actionable insights for better decision-making.  
I'm also focused on building robust data solutions, which led me to dive into **Data Engineering**.  
Plus, I'm exploring **AI-powered automations with N8N** to make workflows smarter and more efficient.  
I'm always eager for new challenges and opportunities to contribute to innovative data projects.
